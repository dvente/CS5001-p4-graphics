# CS5001-p4-graphics
One project I did as an assignment for CS5001 (OOP) during my Masters at the University of St Andrews.
This is a GUI application for a visualisation of the mandelbrot set. I don't plan on maintaining this project. 
This is just to show people something I worked on during my master. If you have any questions about it, don't hesitate to get in contact.
